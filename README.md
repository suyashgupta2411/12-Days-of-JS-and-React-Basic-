12 Days of JS & React Projects üöÄ
Welcome to my 12-day project streak of JavaScript and React projects! Although these are foundational projects, my aim is to infuse each one with a unique creative twist to elevate its quality. This challenge serves as both a practice exercise and a showcase of my ability to bring innovation and polish even to the basics.

Why This Streak?
Having already built more advanced projects, I‚Äôm using this streak as an opportunity to reinforce core concepts and experiment with creative touches that demonstrate my skills in UI/UX, functionality, and code structure. This journey reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my dedication to going beyond standard solutions.
